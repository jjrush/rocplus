# ICSNPP-ROC-PLUS
Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Emerson ROC Plus

## Overview
ICSNPP-ROC-PLUS is a Spicy based Zeek plugin for parsing and logging fields within the ROC Plus protocol.

ROC Plus is a protocol created by Emerson for communication between Emerson devices in industrial automation systems. It is widely used in industrial applications such as oil and gas operations.

This parser targets the ROC Plus commands specified in the publicly available 2022 version of the spec.

## Installation (via zkg)

### Package Manager
This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html). Zeek includes Spicy support by default as of [v6.0.0](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/releases/tag/v6.0.0).

```bash
$ zkg refresh
$ zkg install icsnpp-roc-plus
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running zeek -NN. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_ROC_PLUS_TCP` and `ANALYZER_ROC_PLUS_UDP` under the list of `Zeek::Spicy` analyzers.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Installation (via git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-roc-plus.git
cd icsnpp-roc-plus
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ..
```

From here you can install the locally built files through `zkg install ./icsnpp-roc-plus` and run it like you would normally.

Or you can manually run the parser without installing it: `zeek ./build/roc_plus.hlto ./scripts/__load__.zeek  -Cr <pcap>`


## Log Files
The ROC Plus analyzer generates several log files based on the type of ROC Plus traffic observed. 

## Main ROC Plus Log (roc_plus.log)

This log file contains the core fields for all ROC Plus protocol traffic.

| Field | Type | Description |

| destination_unit | count | Destination unit address |
| destination_group | count | Destination group address |
| source_unit | count | Source unit address |
| source_group | count | Source group address |
| opcode | string | Operation code for the ROC Plus command |
| data_length | count | Length of the following data portion in bytes (not including this byte, the CRC bytes, or the error bytes) |
| lsb_crc | count | Least significant byte of the CRC checksum |
| msb_crc | count | Most significant byte of the CRC checksum |
| error_code | vector of string | Error codes returned in the response (if any) |
| error_offset | vector of count | Offsets where errors occurred (if any) |
